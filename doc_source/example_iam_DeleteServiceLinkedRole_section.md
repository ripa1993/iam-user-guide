```
  # Deletes a service-linked role from the account.
  #
  # @param role [Aws::IAM::Role] The role to delete.
  def delete_service_linked_role(role)
      response = @iam_resource.client.delete_service_linked_role(role_name: role.name)
      task_id = response.deletion_task_id
      while true
        response = @iam_resource.client.get_service_linked_role_deletion_status(
          deletion_task_id: task_id)
        status = response.status
        puts("Deletion of #{role.name} #{status}.")

        end
      end
  rescue Aws::Errors::ServiceError => e
    # If AWS has not yet fully propagated the role, it deletes the role but
    # returns NoSuchEntity.
    if e.code != "NoSuchEntity"
      puts("Couldn't delete #{role.name}. Here's why:")
      puts("\t#{e.code}: #{e.message}")
